--> Open the terminal in mapReduce directory
--> `rm */*.class`
--> `javac */*.java`

Open 4 terminal in the mapReduce directory

----------First------------
Terminal-1: `java main.MapReduceCoordinator`

----------Second-----------(any number of worker terminals as you wish)
Terminal-2: `java main.MapReduceWorker`
Terminal-3: `java main.MapReduceWorker`
Terminal-4: `java main.MapReduceWorker`

Note: First run ```MapReduceCoordinator``` then any number of ```MapReduceWorker```
Note: You can do repeat, because I am deleting mr-out-*.txt files (output generated in previous excetions) are automatically deleting in code.
      So, you don't have to delete it manually.
